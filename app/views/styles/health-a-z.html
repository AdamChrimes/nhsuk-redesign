    <h2 id="what-it-is">What it is</h2>
    <p>The Health A-Z is a directory page on the NHS website where people can look for conditions and sympotoms. It comprises an alphabetical list of anchor links, which jump the user to the relevant letter.</p>

  <h2 id="userneed">User needs</h2>
  <p>As someone with a symptom or condition that I can name or describe, I NEED to be able to look for the right link, SO THAT I find the correct information and advice. </p>

  <h2 id="what-was-being-used">What was being used</h2>
  <p>The previous iteration featured an alphabetical index which confused mobile phone users, leading them to think it was a phone's keyboard, rather than a series of individual text links.</p>

    <h3>During a research lab in 2018:</h3>

    <p>All users were able to use the A-Z list, and this behaved as they expected.</p>

    <p>However, some users missed the quick anchor links at the top of the page, instead opting to scroll through all items</p>

    <p>In these cases users found the list overwhelming </p>

    <p>Some users did not use the “back to top” links, instead opting to scroll to the top of the page</p>

  <h2 id="design-decisions">Design decisions</h2>
  <p>Clearly labelling each alphabetical section helps users orientate themselves. Placing each condition or symptom link in a white panel separated by a 1px divider, gives long lists structure and makes them easier to scan.</p>

  <h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
  <p>The A-Z list is contained within a <span class="example-code-snippet">&lt;nav&gt;</span> element. This element has an aria label attribute with the value <span class="example-code-snippet">Health A-Z Navigation</span>. This will be read out by screen readers that support this attribute to help clarify what the list of links are.</p>
