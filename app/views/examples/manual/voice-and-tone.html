                    <h2>Voice</h2>
                    <p>Our voice is neutral and factual. It's authoritative, but also calm and reassuring.</p>
                    <p>It's empowering, rather than patronising, and personal, rather than formal.</p>
                    <p>We:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>address the user as "you"</li>
                        <li>reassure by saying things like "Sertraline can cause side effects, but many people have no side effects or only minor ones"</li>
                        <li>empower by saying things like "talk to your doctor about..." rather than "your doctor will tell you about..."</li>
                        <li>avoid using "should" as it can sound patronising</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Using a consistent voice is similar to using the same visual style and colours throughout. It reminds users this is a trusted NHS service.</p>

                    <h2>Tone</h2>
                    <p>Tone can change depending on the context. We consider the situation and what the emotional state might be for the user.</p>
                    <p>For example, we may use a direct, serious and reassuring tone when writing about a diagnosis:</p>

                    <div class="nhsuk-c-inset-text">
                        <p>If you've had a stroke or heart attack or are at high risk of a heart attack, your doctor may recommend that you take a daily low dose aspirin. This is different to taking aspirin for pain relief. Only take low dose aspirin if your doctor recommends it.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>We may use an encouraging and conversational tone when writing about exercise or diet:</p>

                    <div class="nhsuk-c-inset-text">
                        <p>It's tempting to skip a session if the weather's bad. But you're less likely to use the weather as an excuse if you've arranged to exercise with a friend or if you're following a training programme.</p>
